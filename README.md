# Homework 2 - CALC YA LATER!  

In this assignment, I was tasked with extending the "CALC YA LATER" calculator app found [here](https://mrbuddh4.github.io/calculator/). Four new buttons have been added to the calculator:

# Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug that prevented users from entering operands with the same prefix. For example, it was not possible to enter the equation "1 * 11".
- Fixed a bug that prevented users from using shift-key characters.
